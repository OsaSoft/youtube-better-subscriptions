<h1>Thanks for using Better Subscriptions for YouTube&trade;!</h1>

<p>
  I hope you like this extension. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Osa_Soft">@Osa_Soft</a>
  or if you find any bugs or have a cool idea for a new feature, let me know on the extension's <a
  href="https://github.com/OsaSoft/youtube-better-subscriptions/">GitHub page</a>!
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of this page is to let you know what's changed or new in the extension and it will show up after
  installing or updating the extension to a new version.
</p>

<h2>What's new in version 0.17.1?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed issue where YT design update caused the detection of videos and therefore hiding them to break on channel
    video pages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thank you everyone for your long patience, as I know you've been wanting a fix since November üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!
    <br/>It's been frustrating not being able to
    get around to this sooner, but on the other hand it really warmed my heart to read so many messages from that many
    people who enjoy
    and care about this extension enough that much!
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What's new in version 0.17.0?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Now you can auto-hide (mark as watched) Shorts! This behaviour is off by default, so you'll have to turn it on in
    the settings page.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed issue with new layout YT is rolling out that broke the feed when a Short was included.</li>
  <li>Fixed some issues with the settings page not loading correctly in certain cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Want to help?</h2>
<p>This extension is developed completely as a hobby project in my free time, if you want to help me, even reaching out
  with a kind word is enough.</p>
<p>Other than that, I would appreciate it if you can help spread the word and get the extension out into more people's
  hands.</p>
<p>For those that would like a more hands-on approach to helping, you can always contribute to the source code on <a
  href="https://github.com/OsaSoft/youtube-better-subscriptions/">GitHub</a>, and if you can't code, there are some
  non-coding things I'd very much appreciate
  some help with (like prettier UI, screenshots, etc). You can see some of those in the <a
    href="https://github.com/OsaSoft/youtube-better-subscriptions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">
    Github issues with the "Help Wanted" tag</a></p>
