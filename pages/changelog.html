<h1>Thanks for using Better Subscriptions for YouTube&trade;!</h1>

<p>
  I hope you like this extension. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Osa_Soft">@Osa_Soft</a>
  or if you find any bugs or have a cool idea for a new feature, let me know on the extension's <a
  href="https://github.com/OsaSoft/youtube-better-subscriptions/">GitHub page</a>!
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of this page is to let you know what's changed or new in the extension and it will show up after
  installing or updating the extension to a new version.
</p>

<h2>What's new in version 0.19.0?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sync watch history across devices (using same browser)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's new in version 0.18.0? (repeating this here, as 0.18.0 did not get published for Chrome)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Enable UI for channel's live video (livestream) history</li>
  <li>Moved forced-grid rules in css to improve performance</li>
  <li>Enabled forced grid layout on all page</li>
  <li>Fix: shorts video query catch "Latest YouTube posts" too</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contributor thank you</h2>
<p>
  Massive kudos to <a href="https://github.com/mocanew">Valentin Mocanu</a> for the tackling the sync storage,
  which has been on my list to do since the very first version of this extension.
</p>

<h2>Want to help?</h2>
<p>This extension is developed completely as a hobby project in my free time, if you want to help me, even reaching out
  with a kind word is enough.</p>
<p>Other than that, I would appreciate it if you can help spread the word and get the extension out into more people's
  hands.</p>
<p>For those that would like a more hands-on approach to helping, you can always contribute to the source code on <a
  href="https://github.com/OsaSoft/youtube-better-subscriptions/">GitHub</a>, and if you can't code, there are some
  non-coding things I'd very much appreciate
  some help with (like prettier UI, screenshots, etc). You can see some of those in the <a
    href="https://github.com/OsaSoft/youtube-better-subscriptions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">
